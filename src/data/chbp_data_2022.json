In early 2016, armed with an education from Penn State's Food Science Course and her rebellious creativity, she opened Sweet Alchemy Ice Creamery in the heart of U-District, Seattle. She continues to pride herself on using ingredients from meticulously selected local farms to deliver the best natural taste through many creative flavors.\n \n\n Sweet Alchemy ice creamery is a WSDA certified creamery, dedicated to producing small batch, organic, and locally sourced ice cream. We craft our Sweet Cream base daily from organic ingredients, most of which are sourced within 100 miles of our storefront. Freshness is of the upmost importance to us, which is why we especially love the dairy from Fresh Breeze Organics, a family owned farm in Lynden, WA. The time from when the milk leaves Fresh Breeze's grass-fed dairy pastures until reaching your cone is on average only one week. This commitment does not stop with our ice cream base -  our sauces, toppings, flavor mix-ins, and waffle cones are also made from scratch in our small shop with ingredients we are proud to serve to our community.",
